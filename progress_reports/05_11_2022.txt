Before Hackathon:
- The goal for today's hackathon:
  Jamie: Create the class for the nn.

During Hackathon:
Successfully linking the neural network to the physical piano.
The player inputs exactly 16 keys and the piano can output the prediction result
of the tempo of 16 predicted keys.

After Hackathon:
Jamie has finished the first step of the abstraction of the neural network.
Things might need to fix:
  - When computing total pd_loss_wrt_output, assuming batch_size = 1.
  - Not supporting dynamic learning rate.
  - Performing one iteration. Users need to use for-loop on their own.
