Music Hackathon 04/13/2022:
Before Hackathon:
- right direction (i.e. ascending) on 40-80 trained on 70-51, one iteration each
- problem: too randomized
- inputs: x, graph: 1/x

During Hackathon:
- initialize all weights/biase to 0
- tested other ranges: 80-120, result is good (graphs on Zulip)
- temporarily happy with the 0-initialization [fix on 04/15: no longer temporarily happy]

After Hackathon:
- need to test noise offset
- need to test if need another layer

[Updates on 04/19/2022]:
The current code works find with noise ranging from [-1,1]. Graphos on Zulip.
Things to be done:
1) Try to find a way for the nn to predict y=3/x, so that we might be able to 
   predict tempo instead of 1/tempo.
2) Try to figure out why the current code does not work with zero initialization;
   if possible, fix it so that it works with random initialization.
3) Make it work with non-zero offsets.
4) Make the new nn robust with reasonable noise.
