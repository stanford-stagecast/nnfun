Music Hackathon 04/13/2022:
Before Hackathon:
- right direction (i.e. ascending) on 40-80 trained on 70-51, one iteration each
- problem: too randomized
- inputs: x, graph: 1/x

During Hackathon:
- initialize all weights/biase to 0
- tested other ranges: 80-120, result is good (graphs on Zulip)
- temporarily happy with the 0-initialization [fix on 04/15: no longer temporarily happy]

After Hackathon:
- need to test noise offset
- need to test if need another layer
