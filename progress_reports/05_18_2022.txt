During hackathon:
- Makeing learning_rate a field variable -> dynamic learning rate.
- Input array instead of hand-input layers (specifially rest).
- Discussed some project ideas.
- Tested abstraction with linear predictor, success.
- Tested abstraction with 1/x, nan. Probably dynamic learning rate is needed.

After hackathon:
Jamie will work on dynamic learning rate.
