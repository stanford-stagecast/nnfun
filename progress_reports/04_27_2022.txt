Before Hackathon:
- The goal for today's hackathon:
  Derek: Listen to synthesizer, research ways that ai models predict 1/x, x^2, try to implement.
  Jamie: After searching online, I find it might be helpful to add more layers 
         and more nodes. I'm going to implement a template to make it more 
         convenient to add more layers and internal nodes.
         Afterwards I'm going to test how many layers or nodes are needed.
