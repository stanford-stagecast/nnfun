Before Hackathon:
- Derek has proved that one layer neural network cannot predict 1/x.
- Hope to solve the four problems described in the previous report.

During Hackathon:
- Somehow fixed 1) and 2) by removing all ''60/'' in the code.
  The code works with random initialization.
  It's also predicting tempo instead of 1/tempo.
  The code works fine with nosie [-1,1]/
  [Update: not really fixed it because gen_time should not be modified]
- There are still some problems with offsets (problem numeber 3).
- Haven't figured out how to build the two-layer nn from current codes.

After Hackathon:
- It seems that it's important to predict 1/x. Before that, we need to be 
  familiar with multi-layer nn.
